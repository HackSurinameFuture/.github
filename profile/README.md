# Hacking Suriname Future

**Transforming Education Through Advanced Thinking and Empowering the Nation's Next Chapter**

Welcome to **HackSurinameFuture**, a community-driven initiative to empower Suriname's youth through high-performance programming education.

We focus on:

- 🧠 Critical thinking and problem-solving through real-world coding
- 📚 Public, reusable curriculum and hands-on project work
- 📈 Measurable impact in schools and communities

### 🎯 Mission
To create an accessible, mobile, and replicable educational model that brings serious programming education to young students in Suriname—starting from age 11—and prepares them to think, build, and solve like future engineers.

### 🧰 What We Offer
- A documented and open curriculum
- Project-based learning modules
- GitHub and Git integration for version control
- Lightweight, portable hardware setups
- A real-world tech stack: Linux, Git, Markdown, Obsidian, and more
