# Hack Suriname Future

> Transforming Education Through Advanced Thinking and Empowering the Nation's Next Chapter

**HackSurinameFuture** is a community-driven initiative to empower young minds in Suriname through serious, real-world programming education starting from age 11. Our goal is to prepare students to think, build, and solve like modern engineers using the same tools and practices found in global tech ecosystems.

## 🎯 Mission

To deliver early, high-impact computing education that combines logic, coding, collaboration, and open documentation—making students capable of solving real problems and shaping their own futures.

---

## 🧩 What We Focus On

- 🧠 Developing critical thinking and algorithmic problem solving
- 💻 Teaching fullstack programming using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- 📦 Promoting the use of open-source tools and open-access learning
- 🗃️ Training in Git, Markdown, Obsidian, and structured documentation
- 📚 Delivering project-based curriculum with measurable outcomes
- 🧪 Encouraging experimentation, teamwork, and autonomy
- 🌍 Building an educational model that is mobile, replicable, and scalable

---

## 🧰 How We Work

- Small student teams meet twice a week for in-person training
- A shared curriculum structured across 6 intensive months
- Low-cost computing setups using tablets, Linux environments, and open tools
- Group projects, individual tasks, and hands-on coding challenges
- Public GitHub repos per team for code, wikis, logs, and collaboration
- Real communication between instructors, students, and families
- Full transparency: all content is open and available to the public

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Linux and command-line interfaces
- Git / GitHub workflows
- Obsidian for personal knowledge management
- JavaScript (core language for both front and back end)
- HTML & CSS (standards-based, no frameworks)
- Node-RED for IoT interaction and real-time logic
- SQLite and basic SQL for data persistence

## 🌟 Why It Matters

This is more than a coding class. It's a blueprint for what computing education in Suriname—and anywhere—could look like. We are building something that can be reproduced, extended, and scaled, with real community involvement and visible educational impact.
